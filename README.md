COVID-19 Vaccination Data Analysis (Using Power BI)

The COVID-19 Vaccination Data Analysis project aims to analyze global vaccination trends using Power BI. The study focuses on understanding the total number of vaccinated and fully vaccinated individuals across different years and countries. The dataset contains information on vaccination counts, daily vaccinations, country-wise trends, and vaccine sources.

Through data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, this project identifies key trends such as top vaccinated countries, highest daily vaccinations, and leading vaccine sources. Using interactive dashboards, it provides a clear representation of vaccination trends, helping policymakers and researchers make informed decisions.

By leveraging Power BIâ€™s data transformation and visualization tools, this analysis highlights critical insights, such as vaccination peaks in 2021, India's leadership in fully vaccinated individuals, and the Ministry of Health as a top reporting source. The study also offers recommendations for improving global vaccination tracking and analysis, emphasizing the importance of region-wise insights and forecasting models for future studies.
